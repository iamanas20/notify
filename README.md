# Notify

The simplest note taking app on the planet. Can be used to write anything you'd like, from small todos to blogging your thoughts.

Give it a try: https://notify-gold.vercel.app/
# Technologies

I Used React, with TypeScript and SCSS modules. For the backend I used https://xano.com to generate a No-Code RESTful API with a database to store the Notes. And to integrate that backend with the frontend I used React-Query.


## Development

After you clone the repo, install the npm packages:

```bash
npm install
// or
yarn install
```

And then run the app locally:

```bash
npm run start
// or
yarn start
```

## Deployment

I've used https://vercel.com for the deployment.
